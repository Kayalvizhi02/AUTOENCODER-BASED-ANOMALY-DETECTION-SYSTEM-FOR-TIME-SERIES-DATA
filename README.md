## AUTOENCODER-BASED ANOMALY DETECTION SYSTEM FOR TIME SERIES DATA
The detection of anomalies in time series data holds immense significance across various domains, including finance, cybersecurity, healthcare, and industrial operations. Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in identifying unusual patterns or behaviors within sequential data, thereby enabling proactive decision-making, risk mitigation, and system optimization.

## About
Detecting anomalies in time series data is crucial across domains like finance, cybersecurity, and healthcare. Autoencoder-based methods have emerged as powerful tools for this task. Autoencoders, neural networks capable of reconstructing input data, excel at capturing complex patterns within sequential data. By identifying instances that deviate significantly from learned patterns, they effectively detect anomalies based on reconstruction error. A threshold for anomaly detection is set using maximum mean absolute error (MAE) loss observed during training on normal data.

## Results and Impact

Designed with meticulous attention to addressing the shortcomings of traditional anomaly
detection methods, this system boasts remarkable efficacy and versatility. Its ability to
automatically learn and adapt to the inherent dynamics of the data enables it to detect subtle
deviations and anomalies with high accuracy, even in the presence of noise and irregularities.
